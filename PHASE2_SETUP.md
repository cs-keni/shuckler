# Phase 2 Setup - One Manual Step Required

Before the app will build and run, you need to add your test MP3 to the project:

## Add the test song

1. **Copy** your MP3 file: `How About a Song (Jubilife City) - Pokémon X and Y (OST).mp3` (from project root)
2. **Paste** it into: `app/src/main/res/raw/`
3. **Rename** it to: `test_song.mp3`

   *(Android raw resources require lowercase names with no spaces or special characters.)*

That's it! Sync Gradle and run the app. Open the Player tab and tap Play.
